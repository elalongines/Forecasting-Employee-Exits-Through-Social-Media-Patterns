# Forecasting-Employee-Exits-Through-Social-Media-Patterns
Predicting employee turnover using social media data, leveraging deep learning and sentiment analysis models.

## About the Project
This repository hosts the code, data preprocessing scripts, and research documentation for the project: "Online Footprints: Forecasting Employee Exits Through Social Media Patterns"
This project is part of the MSc in Applied Information and Data Science program at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts

## Overview
The study investigates employee turnover using social media interaction patterns and sentiment analysis techniques. By leveraging the Avolta dataset, sourced via the Beekeeper platform, it applies cutting-edge deep learning models and sentiment analysis frameworks to predict employee exits among frontline workers.

### Key Research Questions
1. **How effective are deep learning models in predicting employee turnover?**
2. **How do organizational communication networks and sentiment in communications influence employee turnover?**

## Methodology

### Data Sources
